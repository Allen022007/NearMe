        <p>This Cricket ground is a vast, oval-shaped field specifically designed for playing cricket. At its center lies the pitch, a rectangular strip of well-maintained grass or clay, where the main action of the game occurs. Surrounding the pitch is the outfield, a large grassy area bordered by a rope or boundary line marking the field's limits. 
            Cricket grounds often feature seating areas or stands for spectators, along with facilities like pavilions for players to rest and prepare. The ground also includes sightscreens positioned behind the wickets to assist players in seeing the ball clearly. Well-maintained turf, a smooth outfield, and an organized layout are hallmarks of a quality cricket ground.</p>
