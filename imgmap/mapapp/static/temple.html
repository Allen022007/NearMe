        <p>A Sai Baba temple is a serene and spiritual place dedicated to Sai Baba, a revered saint known for his teachings of love, humility, and universal brotherhood. The temple typically houses a sanctum with an idol or portrait of Sai Baba, often adorned with garlands and surrounded by an atmosphere of devotion. Devotees gather here to offer prayers, light lamps, and seek blessings, accompanied by the chanting of bhajans or mantras. The temple premises often include a peaceful courtyard, spaces for meditation, and facilities for distributing prasad (holy offering). Sai Baba temples symbolize faith, harmony, and the message of selfless service to humanity.</p>
